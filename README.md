A demo to learn JWT by reverse engineering

## How To Use It

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitcommitshow/auth-jwt)

1. Head over to the [demo hosted on repl.it](https://auth-jwt--gitcommitshow.repl.co/)

Or run it on your local machine by cloning the repoÂ and running following commands
```javascript
npm install
npm start
// Visit localhost:3000
```
2. Play around with the configurations
3. Read the cues at every page with more resources to go deeper into concepts

### Invalidating JWT

* [Strategies to invalidate jwt - SO Q&A](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21978658/invalidating-json-web-tokens)

> * Simply remove the token from the client
> * Create a token blacklist
> * Just keep token expiry times short and rotate them often
> * Contingency Plans : allow the user to change an underlying user lookup ID with their login credentials

> A common approach for invalidating tokens when a user changes their password is to sign the token with a hash of their password. Thus if the password changes, any previous tokens automatically fail to verify. You can extend this to logout by including a last-logout-time in the user's record and using a combination of the last-logout-time and password hash to sign the token. This requires a DB lookup each time you need to verify the token signature, but presumably you're looking up the user anyway.
